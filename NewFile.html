I'm working in the cloud. This is how it should be! I will show you how to setup WordPress development and production servers on Amazon or any other cloud provider. All you need is a Chrome browser and a decent internet connection to share screens and remote control desktops. $50/hr.

<h3>What can you do for me, John?</h3>
I'm ready to go, and can start <em>delivering</em> software to you in 24 hours. I'm definitely looking for something long term, but I think it's best to hire me as a 1099 to start. I know how to write feature files and talking about software is my thing. Let's talk! I can deliver software on any scale, from doing things myself to helping you hire unlimited numbers of outsourcers. I pretty much I guarantee I can reduce your costs.
